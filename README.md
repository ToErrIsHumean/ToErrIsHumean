# To Err is Humean, a machine learning / AI repo

## Vision
Aug 12, 2023

*humean, adj.: relating to or characteristic of philosopher [David Hume](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/)*

Hume was an empiricist who focused on the study of human nature, and explored many ideas which are relevant to
the Age of AI.  Hume posited that our inferences are almost always formed through induction and experience, rather 
than a priori knowledge.  More controversially, he tried to show that morality cannot emerge from pure rationality.
He believed sentiment, not reason, is the driving force that creates morals and guides what we "ought" to do.

Machines can describe **what is**, but only humans can prescribe **what ought**.[1]

Also, if errors are human and forgiveness divine, I hope my GitHub repo will divinely reflect my incredible humanity.  Amen.

[1]: until the Sentimentality Singularity occurs, upon which we will all collectively throw up our hands and shrug our shoulders


## Purpose

To explore my interest in machine learning and AI, particularly Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), game theory, complex and
hyper-complex neural net weight representations, decision theory and heuristics, and more.

To build projects that interest me and may be of interest to the larger community.

To learn to code better models.

## Resources

This repository holds some of my machine learning coursework, experiments and implementation projects.

I may also upload public learning materials (such as free textbooks and lecture notes).

I'll provide attribution where I can.  I'm new to ML and serious programming, having just started in July 2023.
My background is in math and business.
