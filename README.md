humean, adj.: relating to or characteristic of philosopher David Hume: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/

Hume was an empiricist who focused on the study of human nature, and explored many ideas which are relevant to
the Age of AI.  Hume posited that our inferences are almost always formed through induction and experience, rather 
than a priori knowledge.  More controversially, he tried to show that morality cannot emerge from pure rationality.
He believed sentiment, not reason, is what prescribes what we "ought" to do.

Machines can only describe "what Is".  Humans are the only ones who can prescribe "what Ought".

Also, if errors are human and forgiveness divine, I hope my GitHub repository will divinely reflect my incredible humanity.  Amen.
